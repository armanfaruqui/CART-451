      <h1>Exhausting a Crowd - Kyle McDonald</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Exhausting a Crowd is an online crowdsourced art that allows users to
        annotate anything in the pre-recorded 12 hours footage recorded by the
        street surveillance camera from cities around the world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My first 10 minutes on the website had me enthralled with amusement. I
        couldn't help but audibly laugh when a user-generated text box stating
        “make sure you get my good angle” appeared over the head of someone
        posing next to a statue for a photo her friend was taking. Even ones
        that didn’t make sense, such as a user tagging an interestingly shaped
        streetlight as “a public mind control device” felt like premium was
        perceived by my brain as premium entertainment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It was only when I read an article about it that I understood the
        artist’s intention behind the project. A topic much more serious than
        what my reaction led me to believe; the normalization of public
        surveillance. We can all probably think of moments in our week that we
        would prefer not to have annotated by a 14-year teenager from across the
        globe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But why was it that even though I’m enrolled in a university program
        which places so much importance on awareness and questioning of
        developing technologies, this idea did not even cross my mind? How could
        a project about an ethical issue become a global source of
        entertainment?

      <h1>Lauren McCarthy: Asking the right questions
        <br />
      </h1>
      <p>Technology that allows a machine to listen, record, and respond to information around us has been so seamlessly integrated into our lives, to the point that it’s almost hidden from us. Those that do choose to pay closer attention to this trend, tend to focus on 2 contrasting sides of it; what the technology can and will be able to provide for us, and the danger it possibly puts us under. Lauren McCarthy attempts to acknowledge the grey area between these 2 truths by situating herself in scenarios that allow her to experience and observe this phenomenon from various unexplored angles. </p><br>
      <p>Playing the role of a family’s Alexa for a day questions the nature of the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence designed to serve the former. Allowing her behavior and decisions on a date to be determined by feedback forms filled by Amazon Turk workers in real-time questions the nature of agency in a world where we can be influenced by so much more than those physically present around us. </p><br>
      <p>What I find most interesting is her observation regarding the lack of “people skills” amongst those designing and distributing these services. Based on how these technologies are embodied and lived in each of our lives as extensions of ourselves and our social network, the lack of design and analysis through a social paradigm is something very important for each of us consumers to question.</p><br>
